# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 4.2.0
### Added
- Collapse pinned posts (shazbot): hides pinned posts on the thread index and provides a clickable area to reopen them
- Added isThread() function to API: returns true if the current window location is a thread inside of a magazine

### Changed
- Filter advertisements: updated spam filter to v2 logic

## 4.1.1
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where the tappable navbar created when using the "Show thread/microblog delta since last visit" would not be removed when toggling the add-on off

## 4.1.0
### Added
- Filter advertisements (shazbot): removes unsolicited advertisements and blocks the poster

### Fixed

- Move federation warning: ensure that the add-on also applies to pages on the All Content area (kbin only)
- Remove extraneous double border on KES icon in navbar when hovering
- Ensure that kbin navbar accommodates extra width when KES icons are added
- Resize text: prevent this feature from causing the KES modal to become opaque when the "Collapsible Comments" feature is also enabled

### Changed

- Updated build scripts
- API: made getInstanceType() logic more granular

## 4.0.0
### Added
- Unsanitize CSS (Pamasich): unsanitizes custom CSS on magazines to restore working functionality of custom styles
- Fix pagination arrows (Pamasich): fixes broken pagination arrows when navigating between pages by restoring functionality to the back/forward buttons
- Added a "Fixes" category to the sidebar that holds add-ons responsible for patches, fixes, and connecting glue

### Changed
- Mail label: this add-on was split into two, with the "Add submission prefix" add-on being added
- Code syntax highlighting: now treats "Repair codeblocks" as a necessary dependency, so the act of turning on "Code syntax highlighting" will perforce turn on "Repair codeblocks"
- Move federation warning to sidebar: updated this add-on to also support profile pages
- Repair codeblocks: now treats "Code syntax highlighting" as dependent, so the act of turning off "Repair codeblocks" will perforce turn off "Code syntax highlighting"
- Resize text: the add-on now attempts to parse the current point size of elements on the page, rather than defaulting to 14pt
- Resize text: the add-on now gracefully toggles off without needing to reload the page
- Resize text: consolidated resize logic into a single stylesheet and dropped extraneous fields

### Fixed
- Audited all add-ons and added compatibility with mbin instances
- Releasing a click action on the KES sidebar while multiple pages were highlighted could break the menu
- GitHub's redirection and caching mechanism could cause the contents of the KES menu to appear garbled
- Add mail: fixed an issue where mail links would appear next to your own username
- Clarify recipient: recipient label now appears on the direct message page, not only the inbox reply page
- Code syntax highlighting: restored a missing divider line between the header and code block
- Code syntax highlighting: unintended interaction with "Collapsible comments" add-on was causing header icons to be unclickable
- Hover indicator: fixed an issue where the indicator would not appear unless the add-on's color field had been explicitly interacted with before
- Magazine instance names: disabling this add-on would remove checkmarks created by the "Checkmark on subbed mags" add-on
- Notification panel: fixed an issue where settings applied to the panel would sometimes leak into other menus
- Report bug button: this add-on now also applies to the original post in a thread, but not on crossposts

### API
- Added the keys depends_on and depends_off to manifest to support add-on dependencies
- Consolidated add-ons into global funcs.js file to reduce repository queries
- Added function concatenation script and ephemeral gist generator to build tools
- Added KES internal function getComputedFontSize() to retrieve rendered point size from element IDs
- Added public utility function getInstanceName() to test whether an instance is of the type kbin or mbin

## 3.3.0
### Added
- Alternative access to All Content (Pamasich): makes the magazine title in the navbar link to the All Content view and removes the dedicated button
- Show new features added in current release: click the button on the search menu to list new add-ons incorporated into KES since the current minor version. E.g., if you are on version 3.2.x, this button
  will show all relevant add-ons since 3.2.0. Under the hood, this button performs a query using the `:new` keyword.
- Search keywords: added a set of reserved keywords that can be used to search for add-ons matching certain criteria: `:new`, `:recurs`, and `:login`. These respectively will return a list of add-ons
  that are a) new to the current minor version; b) recur each time new content is updated on the page (comments, replies, infinite scrolling, etc.); and c) requires logging in to use.

### Changed
- Alpha sort add-ons in pages: the pages listing add-ons are now sorted alphabetically by add-on title
- Start search field focused: when opening the search menu, the text field is automatically focused

### Fixed
- Prevent add-ons from applying settings in some cases if the add-on is toggled off
- Hide logo: added support for Mbin instances
- Fixed cases where add-ons providing sub-settings initially set to true revert to false
- Fixed an issue where changes to kbin's styling caused extraneous checkmarks to be drawn next to checkboxes

## 3.2.2
### Fixed

- Collapsible comments: fixed an issue with expand text buttons not working when nested comments are enabled
- Collapsible comments: removed rounded corners from avatars, as this was undocumented/unspecified by the add-on
